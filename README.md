## Introduction

Welcome to the Universidad de Chile SumoBot Project! This repository contains the design, code and documentation for a competitive sumo robot built by a team of engineering students at the Universidad de Chile. The goal of this project is to create a powerful and agile sumobot capable of competing in local and international sumo robot competitions.

## Features

- Custom mechanical design optimized to be difficult to flip
- Advanced control algorithms for precise movement and decision-making
- Built-in object detection and tracking using sensors
- Modular design for easy hardware and software upgrades
- Comprehensive documentation for building and programming the sumobot

## Hardware Requirements

The following components are required to build the Universidad de Chile SumoBot:

- Gearmotor with Wheel
- Battery
- Driver
- Infrared Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Arduino
- Wheel Omnidirectional
- Cables
- Protoboard

## Software Requirements

- IDE for microcontroller programming (e.g. Arduino IDE, Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO)
- Libraries for motor control, sensor interfacing and communication
- C++ for custom algorithms and control logic (other supported programming languages are optional, we will use C++)
