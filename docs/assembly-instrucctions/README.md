# Assembly Instructions

These assembly instructions will guide you through the step-by-step process of assembling your sumobot. Please refer to the included photos and diagrams for better understanding.

## Required Tools

Before you begin, make sure you have the following commercial components:

- Gearmotor with Wheel
- Battery
- Driver
- Infrared Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Arduino
- Wheel Omnidirectional

For more information go to the [hardware list](https://github.com/matiasAguirreE/project-sumobot/tree/main/docs/hardware-list) file.

## Step 1: 3D Print Non-Commercial Components

1. Print the non-commercial components of the [3D files](https://github.com/matiasAguirreE/project-sumobot/tree/main/docs/3d-files) using a 3D printer.

## Step 2: Assemble all the Components

1. Gather all the components you printed and prepare them for assembly.
2. Attach the gearmotor with wheel to the chassis.
3. Connect the battery to the power input on the driver.
4. Mount the infrared and ultrasonic sensors onto the chassis.
5. Connect the sensors to the appropriate ports on the driver.
6. Attach the omnidirectional wheel to the chassis.

## Step 3: Connecting Electronics

1. Connect the various electronic components together according to the provided instructions.
2. Connect the driver to the Arduino using jumper wires.
3. Make sure all the connections are secure and properly aligned.

## Step 4: Import Code

1. Import the [code](https://github.com/matiasAguirreE/project-sumobot/tree/main/docs/code) into your Arduino board for the sumobot's functionality.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.

## Step 5: Testing

1. Test the assembled sumobot to ensure all the components are working correctly.
2. Power on the sumobot and observe its behavior.
3. Verify if the sensors are detecting obstacles and the wheels are moving as expected.

Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your sumobot. If you have any questions or encounter any issues during the assembly process, please refer to any of the team members of this proyect, or contribute to the proyect following the instructions on the Contributing section on the [README](https://github.com/matiasAguirreE/project-sumobot/tree/main#contributing) file.
